# Quantum Circuit Builder
## A program which allows users to construct quantum circuits 

Users could construct a quantum circuit with quantum gates and calculate the probability states of qubit inputs. Also implemented the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm to simulate the theoretical benefits of quantum computing and quantum algorithms.
