# Quantum Circuit Builder
## A program which allows users to construct quantum circuits 

Users could construct a quantum circuit with quantum gates and calculate the probability states of qubit inputs. Also implemented the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm to simulate the theoretical benefits of quantum computing and quantum algorithms.

Comes equipped with Hadamard, Identity, NOT, CNOT, SWAP and AT gates. This allows the user to construct a multitude of different quantum circuits. Algorithm steps qubits through the user constructed circuit, calculating all required tensor products and matrix products, until final tensors are obtained, encoding qubits quantum probability in each basis state. User can induce wave function collapse on qubit, forcing it into one of its' states. User can also entangle qubits with a circuit.
